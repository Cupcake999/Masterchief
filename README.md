custard
 Pour 2Â½ cups milk to a heavy bottom pan. Meanwhile add 3 tablespoons custard powder to a small mixing bowl. The mixture has to be smooth without lumps. When the milk turns hot (not boiling), regulate the flame to low and add 2 tablespoons of the custard milk to it. You can use a whisk or a spatula to mix it.
